# Improving CTG Analysis Accuracy Using ML and Active Sampling

**Machine Learning-based system for accurate fetal health classification using CTG data and active sampling.**

---

## 📘 Abstract

Pregnancy complications remain a major concern in maternal and fetal healthcare, where early and accurate detection is essential for effective intervention.  
Conventional manual interpretation of Cardiotocography (CTG) data is time-consuming and often subjective, leading to inconsistencies in fetal health assessment.

To address this, the present study proposes an efficient **machine learning-based system** utilizing the **XGBoost algorithm** with **active sampling**, known for superior performance with structured data.  
Using a publicly available CTG dataset, the model achieves an **accuracy of 96%**, outperforming earlier approaches.

This system enhances diagnostic precision, reduces clinician workload, and supports timely clinical decision-making, advancing automated fetal health evaluation and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.
